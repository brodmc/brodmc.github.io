title: Is University Worth it?
---
If you peruse much of the social media online you will come across a lot of material that asks *is a degree necessary/worth it to get into IT in 202x?*

I get that people are trying to ascertain how necessary the effort is that they might need to commit to, so I'll save you the effort:

 **yes**

Even if it's long and difficult

Even if you have a friend that *"didn't even use 90% of my degree!"*

Even if your personal hobbies have always involved computers... Especially even then. No one gives a shit about your gaming hobbies and no it doesn't translate exactly to IT skills.

Aside from the things that people normally tout such as critical thinking etc etc, you get a chance to explore many ways of working and tools that you would otherwise not be exposed to on your own training.

I'll give you an idea about some stuff I learned at university that has been critical to my success but in no way relevant to what I was going there for in the first place, *in no particular order*:

+ **Python**
  + I had no need for this in my original career choice. I slowly gained an interest in this and realised that coding and scripting was actually beneficial for much more of my work that I had ever anticipated.
+ **SQL**
  + I was forced to learn SQL for database related courses. This was in no way related whatsoever to my original goals for university education, but turned out to be one of my most critically utilised skills.
+ **Process Modelling**
  + This is a useful skill that can pretty much apply to everyone's job. I had no idea about UML or BPMN and had no need to for my original career goals, however, it has been able assist in more than one position I've worked at because being able to visualise a process means being able to improve it.
+ **Writing Documentation**
  + This one has been extremely important. You need to be able to communicate in a clear and precise manner in order to make a point and show the why. This was not a necessity for my original goals but has helped out tremendously when communicating important information.
+ **Understanding Where to Source Information**
  + Cannot understate why  this is so important. This is the difference between knowing how to identify an authoritative source of information and referencing the first thing you find on Google. You can save yourself much embarrassment by knowing how to identify the best sources of information.

The key thing about all of the above is that if I did not go to university, there's no way that I would have been exposed to those skills and find ways to apply them broadly in my career. This is because in my own self-education, I would have been more focused on *only* the skills I required for a specific job, rather than being exposed to skills and methods outside of my comfort and knowledge zone.

Essentially, university education exposes you to things you never thought you would need to know.

food for thought.
