title: The Best Projects I've done
---
I know that I prattle on a bit about some of the bullshit that I've had to deal with in the IT industry, but I've yet to talk about the best projects I've worked on. So without further ado...

1. Most of my projects as a Technician. This was mainly installing fibre optic cabling from the Optical Equipment Frame (OEF) to the High Density Optical Distribution Frame (HDODF), and sometimes installing the entire device or cards/SFPs into the device. I loved splicing, could get 144 perfect splices done in a day with a Fujikura 60S and a Fitel cleaver. All of the construction projects were run Waterfall/Prince2 with a light touch in terms of my responsibility in communication. There was a comment section that was used to communicate status of my part of the work, and I would almost never really speak to the Project Manager. Unfortunately for me, being a Technician had a pay ceiling and I also sustained a hernia as a result of trying to crawl in a cable run that was too tight for me, so after that, I didn't really want to run cable anymore.

Now, after I moved from being a Technician into an office based IT worker, the project quality dropped significantly, so the remaining items on this list are also probably going to be in my *worst projects I've worked on* list... but I'm taking silver linings out of the remaining list because I gained so much from them.

2. A digital transformation project that was bringing a customer from antiquated ways of working into modern methods. This project sucked a lot less than some of the other projects I've worked on so it is higher on this list. The reason I consider it one of the best projects I've worked on is because I was able to utilise some of my really technical skills that I learned at university, such as documentation, modelling, programming, and version control. Previous roles and projects hadn't allowed me to flex in this way so although this project turned out to be a shit show, I was able to affirm and expand my technical skill set.
3. The development of a legacy SDH decommissioning workflow tool. This was very cool because I had moved over from another role, and I got a chance to use my Business Analysis skills to do a full requirements elicitation and design a database schema that had been normalised down to BCNF. I learned so much about SDH at that time and had almost become a go-to guy for legacy SDH between different units.
4. The legacy access network decommission. The project itself was... stupid... BUT!!! I was able to do everything faster than everyone else because I knew how to target the right jobs and how to do the analysis quicker. Worked out great for me because the requirement was to do 2.5 jobs a week, and I nailed that in 1 day. Rest of the time I spent watching movies and playing with my daughter. This is where I really started to find my place and understand where my career was going.

This is literally all I can write down and the last 3 items are really pushing it because 2 of them will also be in my worst projects list. Surely you can see the pattern here - that like I said, the vast majority of IT projects I've worked on were absolute garbage. Perhaps it's time to do a list of worst projects?

Stay tuned!
