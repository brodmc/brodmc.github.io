title: Are All IT Projects Dumpster Fires?
---
I came across a Reddit thread asking if all IT projects are dumpster fires (with the consensus being yes), and it got me thinking about my experiences across my career.

When I was a technician, I found that the projects were actually structured very well. The engineering briefs were very explicit about the scope, and the general instruction was mapped out really well.

When I moved from being a technician into more general IT roles, the project quality, structure, and governance, went down the complete shitter.

There was a technology decommissioning project which was somewhat ok, but wildly wasteful because the process was archaic and driven by agents of regression - they weren't interested in trying to make the process less fucking stupid and targeted me specifically when I tried to make things better.

I then got promoted to manage automation related to technology decommission but also to continue to drive automation projects for business value. The funding structure of that unit was based on the idea of obtaining capex funding for new projects without mentioning that the automation was not getting handed off and progressively adding to the opex load. It was an absolute garbage role and I couldn't stomach the idea of bidding for 100% capex funding when more than 50% of the developers work was opex related.

A bit after that there was the digital transformation project where the customer was being brought from working in the early 2000s to modern technology. The problem with this project was that there was no buy-in from either the customer or our management on what we were doing, so whenever we did a showcase there was poor acceptance from the client. It was a complete waste of time and it was clear that no one had locked down the requirements from the customer.

I could go on and on, but yes, I would agree that most of the IT projects I've worked on have been absolute garbage.

If you work in IT you will work on dumpster fire projects. Should you care if you're in a dumpster fire project? this begs the question - what is the point of working in IT if the projects suck?

The point of working in IT is to make good money. There are many types of dumpster fire projects but you need only work ones that you can cope with. 

Under-resourced and over-worked? Jump ship.

over-promised but sufficient time? Ride that shit out to the deadline then jump ship.

You don't need to stay for the duration of a project to benefit your career, and the modern day modus operandi of working in IT seems to accept job hopping anyway... So jump ship when you've had your fill!

to the victor go the dumpster fire!
