title: Scrum is Fucking Stupid
---
The Agile methodology Scrum is fucking stupid.

Everyone knows this and everyone hates it. In fact, here is a list of what most IT project workers know to be true about Scrum:

+ Daily stand-ups are unnecessary and almost always devolve into off topic nonsense or completely detailed project status reports. Even bi-weekly stand-ups suffer the same fate.
+ A full team appearance is not necessary for a showcase. The Scrum Master and Product Owner are capable of passing on feedback.
+ Retrospectives become a waste of time very quickly when management do not address a grievance. The same shit will get brought up over and over again.
+ The role of Scrum Master seems largely unnecessary and geared towards justifying their own existence. I don't need constant guidance on the sprint format or to listen when others need shit repeated, and in general, no one gives a fuck about your burndown charts. Did you get shit done this sprint? Yes or no?
+ The excessive meetings/ceremonies are ridiculous.

The only thing that I found to be nice about Scrum was the insistence on aligning your story points with an arbitrary limit for the upcoming sprint in planning meetings. This at least was some kind of acknowledgement that there is a limit to how much stuff can get done... even though it is likely that you would do more stuff anyway because what is planned is not always what is executed.

What is really annoying about Scrum is that it is not practiced as a standardised model, which means that for every new job you get, you could have to learn a new way that the company practices Scrum. The fact that it isn't practiced the same way everywhere means that it is not palatable enough in its raw form.

The reason that I think Scrum is fucking stupid is simply because it is an unnecessary overlay to existing project management/workflow management tools. We all use project management/workflow tools now to drive the Agile methodologies, so we should at least be able to achieve the following **without** any additional meetings:

+ User story/task updates should be available in the comments of the issue. Project updates in general should be aggregated by the lead and presented on behalf of the team. It is unnecessary for everyone to present their part. If someone doesn't do comments → Lead/PM/PO/Whatever contacts them.
+ Blockers can be easily submitted into the project management/workflow management tool.
+ Requests for help can be done via some sort of team chat that is prioritised.
+ Sprint planning can and should be done by an individual by a due date before the next sprint. If someone doesn't do the planning → Lead/PM/PO/Whatever contacts them. If I have a work dependency or need for someone else to know what I'm doing then I will let them know.
+ Showcases should be a voluntary thing for everyone but the lead. I already know what I've achieved for the product, everyone else has already let me know what they've done, so I don't need to watch the reaction of the Product Owner/Manager/Customer. Feedback can flow back through the lead/PM/etc.
+ Retrospectives in my opinion are a waste of time and more often than not seem to produce reptition or frustration. Can't we have a place to submit improvement proposals or anonymous feedback that makes it directly to management for action? Perhaps the lead generates a user story/issue directly for management that must get addressed as a priority?

Can't we all just agree that excessive meetings hamper the progress of delivery and that much of the communication can be done via a system nowadays for those of us that don't wish to communicate constantly with the team?

I just want to get shit done bro!
