title: Scrum is Fucking Stupid
---
The Agile methodology Scrum is fucking stupid.

Everyone knows this and everyone hates it. In fact, here is a list of what most IT project workers know to be true about Scrum:

+ Daily stand-ups are unnecessary and almost always devolve into off topic nonsense or completely detailed project status reports. Even bi-weekly stand-ups suffer the same fate.
+ A full team appearance is not necessary for a showcase. The Scrum Master and Product Owner are capable of passing on feedback.
+ Retrospectives become a waste of time very quickly when management do not address a grievance. The same shit will get brought up over and over again.
+ The role of Scrum Master seems largely unnecessary and geared towards justifying their own existence. I don't need constant guidance on the sprint format or to listen when others need shit repeated, and in general, no one gives a fuck about your burndown charts. Did you get shit done this sprint? Yes or no?
+ Enough with the fucking meetings.

The only thing that I found to be nice about Scrum was the insistence on aligning your story points with an arbitrary limit for the upcoming sprint in planning meetings. This at least was some kind of acknowledgement that there is a limit to how much stuff can get done... even though it is likely that you would do more stuff anyway because what is planned is not always what is executed.

What is really annoying about Scrum is that it is not practiced as a standardised model, which means that for every new job you get, you could have to learn a new way that the company practices Scrum. The fact that it isn't practiced the same way everywhere means that it is not palatable enough in its raw form.

I don't disagree with using Agile where appropriate (small-to-medium projects), but I do think that the way the methodology is executed should be decided by the team. This would involve deciding the way that the team communicates and delivers, while optimising the methodology in order to satisfy the Project Managers/Product Owner.

Waterfall is awesome though. You pretty much always know which project phase you're in and you get to sit through lengthy meetings where there is no expectation for you to contribute... and lets be honest,  whatever meeting we're having, I'm pretty much playing Farcry 2 or 3 anyway.
