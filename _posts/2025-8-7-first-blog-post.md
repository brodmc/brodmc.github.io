title: My First Blog Post
---

I have decided to start a blog for my thoughts about working in the IT industry. I intend to be very real and raw so that you, the reader, may gain something out of this if you are currently working in IT or are seeking to work in IT.

I am a Business Analyst that specialises in Telecommunications systems and Data. I have nearly a decade of experience in IT and 12 years of experience in another field. I started in IT as a Telecommunications Technician but moved to different roles by way of opportunity and hard work. I have experience in private and government work. 

I am writing this because I have always wanted an outlet to express my gratitude and frustrations of the industry that has fed me well for nearly the past decade. I want to give you an idea of what the tech sector and government work is really like from someone who has covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time. I want to give you the cheat codes to the IT industry.


*Regards,*
