title: The Worst Projects I've done, Part 1
---
I'm going to start a series here on the worst projects I've worked on. This series is going to be ordered chronologically, starting after I left my role as a Technician, and started to work as a general IT worker. This will not necessarily convey how bad the projects were in any particular order, however, the projects did become progressively worse and the last project in this series will in fact be the worst. Buckle up, Buckeroo.
