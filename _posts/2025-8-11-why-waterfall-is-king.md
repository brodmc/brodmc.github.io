title: Why Waterfall is King
---
If Scrum is fucking stupid then what is Waterfall? Waterfall is your king and you will bow down in respect.

I've been thinking a lot about what project management methodologies I've worked with in my career since I wrote my post on Scrum. What has occurred to me, is that I probably haven't seen successful implementations of Agile methodologies.

I'm not going to play the *no true Scotsman* game; I still genuinely believe that Agile is dogshit for many reasons. Now I like some aspects of Agile, but largely I think that since the focus is to 'empower' the team with owning more of the project management structure, really all that has happened is that the responsibility for certain aspects of project management has shifted to the team... which is stupid.

So where did this all begin? If you read through enough of the Agile history and cut through all the bullshit you can see that historically speaking, there has always been a disconnection between the development team and the project management team. I get the sense that this may have been due to a few factors:

+ The personalities and behavior of IT workers in the past (there are stereotypes for a reason).
+ The lack of collaboration technology available today.
+ The lack of Business Analysts being employed broadly. Neckbeards have traditionally sucked at communicating technical to project.

Enter Agile - the solve to the communication problem. Sure, there was probably lots of initial success, but as IT projects have changed, the people hired into IT has changed, and the collaboration tools have become better and more distributed, do we really need Agile? No we don't.

What we should be doing, is taking all these changes and advances, and using them to strengthen the original MVP - Waterfall.

Waterfall is very applicable to most IT projects, and with all of the recent changes to people and technology, it can finally restore it's place on the throne. Waterfall is even more necessary now due to the complex nature of IT projects. Think about it - we're not building monolithic systems anymore. We're integrating a multitude of systems together, all of which has specific functional and non-functional requirements to meet. That level of complexity requires documentation and sign-off, and you cannot hope to achieve such complexity with the light touch of Agile.

A big complaint about Waterfall is that it's not flexible. Well you know what Agile is? Too flexible. Let's face it, we have to accept a degree of flexibility with IT projects nowadays, but not locking down a solid set of requirements is completely fucking stupid. Agile allows the goalposts to change far too often, and in large and complex IT projects, that's catastrophic.

What you really need to make Waterfall work is an excellent Business Analyst that can elicit and anticipate requirements so that so much change is not necessary. Get the requirements right in the first place and there shouldn't be such dramatic changes.

Now, I'm not saying that you won't have meetings in Waterfall, but at least you won't be wasting time with ceremonies that you don't need to be part of. You should be able to have short and general meetings with your team on strategy and status updates but that should largely be it. The rest of the meetings that should be voluntary would not require your participation, with the Technical Leads, Business Analysts, Project Managers, and Project Sponsors doing the talking.

Imagine all the free time you could have if you weren't encumbered by bullshit meetings.

It's time for the return of the King.
